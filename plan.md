Integration Plan: BGE Chatbot + Shopify + Agent Dashboard

1. Shopify Integration
   Step 1: Create a Shopify App or Theme Embed
   You have two main options:
   Shopify Theme Customization:
   Export your chatbot as a standalone component
   Add the script to your Shopify theme's theme.liquid file
   Shopify App (more professional):
   Package your chatbot as a Shopify App
   Let store owners install it through the Shopify App Store
   Step 2: Embed the Chatbot Widget Script
   Apply to plan.md
   Step 3: Create a Standalone Version of the Chatbot
   Extract the Chatbot.tsx component into a version that can be used from a CDN
   Use webpack/rollup to bundle it for external use
   Configure CORS to allow Shopify domains to access your API
2. Backend API Configuration
   Step 1: Set Up API Routes for Cross-Domain Use
   Apply to plan.md
   Step 2: Create Environment Variables for Different Deployments
   Development: Your local environment
   Staging: For testing before production
   Production: Final deployed version
   Step 3: Set Up Authentication for Admin Dashboard
   Your UserProvider already handles this
   Ensure routes are protected for agent access
   Implement CSRF protection for all authenticated routes
3. Agent Dashboard Enhancements
   Step 1: Agent Status Management System
   Add online/offline/away status for agents
   Create user interface for agents to set their status
   Build routing logic to distribute chats based on agent availability
   Step 2: Improve Chat Session Handling
   Add session persistence (database storage)
   Implement read receipts for messages
   Add chat transcript export functionality
   Step 3: Enhance the Agent Dashboard Interface
   Add notification sounds for new chats
   Create a more robust queue display for waiting customers
   Implement chat transfer between agents
4. Socket.io Infrastructure Updates
   Step 1: Scale Your Socket Service
   Configure Redis adapter for Socket.io to handle multiple server instances
   Set up production-ready WebSocket configurations
   Apply to plan.md
   Step 2: Implement Robust Error Handling
   Add reconnection logic for dropped connections
   Implement message queue for offline delivery
5. Deployment Architecture
   Deployment Setup
   Frontend (Next.js):
   Deploy to Vercel or similar service
   Set up custom domain with SSL
   Backend (API + Socket):
   Deploy to a Node.js hosting service that supports WebSockets
   Configure scaling for high traffic
   Database:
   Your project is set up with Prisma, so deploy a managed database service
   Set up proper backup schedules
6. Implementation Timeline
   Phase 1: Basic Integration (2-3 weeks)
   Create standalone chatbot widget
   Implement Shopify embedding
   Set up cross-domain communication
   Phase 2: Enhanced Agent Dashboard (2-3 weeks)
   Improve agent interface
   Add session handling
   Implement notifications
   Phase 3: Production Hardening (1-2 weeks)
   Scale Socket.io
   Performance testing
   Security audits
7. Testing Plan
   Unit Testing:
   Test individual components
   Mock socket connections
   Integration Testing:
   Test communication between systems
   Verify data flows correctly
   End-to-End Testing:
   Test full customer-to-agent workflow
   Verify all features working together
   Next Steps
   I recommend:
   Create a bundled version of your chatbot that can be loaded on external sites
   Set up CORS and proper API security for cross-domain communication
   Test the agent dashboard with multiple simultaneous conversations
   Begin building the Shopify integration script
   Would you like me to help you implement any specific part of this plan first?
