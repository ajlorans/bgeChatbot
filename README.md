## Socket.io Communication Architecture

The live-agent-session-ending branch implements an enhanced Socket.io architecture:

1. **Multi-channel Delivery**: Messages are sent through multiple channels to ensure delivery:

   - Direct to specific session rooms
   - To role-based rooms (agents/customers)
   - Global broadcasts as fallback

2. **Room Management**:

   - Users are automatically added to role-based rooms upon connection
   - Session IDs are explicitly converted to strings for consistent room naming
   - Sessions have dedicated rooms for targeted communication

3. **Message Deduplication**:

   - Messages are checked for duplicates by ID
   - Content-based duplicate detection prevents similar messages
   - Timestamp proximity checks prevent duplicates with different IDs

4. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Periodic polling refreshes data if socket events are missed
   - Session status is periodically checked to detect changes
   - System messages are generated for important events like chat ending
