            "- 1 large onion, finely chopped\n" +
            "- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n" +
            "- 1 tablespoon ginger, grated\n" +

            "- 1 cup heavy cream\n" +
            "- Fresh cilantro for garnish\n\n" +
            "## Instructions\n\n" +
            "1. **Marinate the chicken**: Combine all marinade ingredients in a bowl, add chicken and coat well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.\n\n" +
            "2. **Setup your EGG**: Set up your Big Green Egg for direct cooking at 400Â°F (204Â°C).\n\n" +
            "3. **Grill the chicken**: Thread marinated chicken onto skewers and grill for 7-8 minutes, turning occasionally, until chicken is cooked through with nice char marks.\n\n" +
            "4. **Prepare the sauce**: In a cast iron skillet on the EGG, heat the ghee and sautÃ© onions until soft. Add garlic and ginger, cook for 1 minute. Add all spices and cook for another minute until fragrant.\n\n" +
            "5. **Finish the dish**: Add tomato sauce and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Stir in the heavy cream and grilled chicken. Simmer for another 5-10 minutes until sauce thickens.\n\n" +

            "- 1/4 cup black pepper, coarsely ground\n" +

            "- 2 tablespoons onion powder\n" +
            "- Optional: 1/4 cup beef broth for spritzing\n\n" +
            "## Instructions\n\n" +
            "1. **Prepare the brisket**: Trim excess fat, leaving about 1/4 inch fat cap. Mix salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to create a rub. Apply rub generously to all sides of the brisket.\n\n" +
            "2. **Setup your EGG**: Set up your Big Green Egg for indirect cooking with the ConvEGGtor. Add a few chunks of oak or hickory wood for smoke. Stabilize temperature at 250Â°F (121Â°C).\n\n" +
            "3. **Smoke the brisket**: Place brisket on the grill, fat side up. Insert a temperature probe if available. Close the dome and maintain 250Â°F.\n\n" +
            "4. **The smoking process**:\n" +
            "   - Smoke for about 6 hours or until internal temperature reaches 165Â°F (74Â°C)\n" +
            "   - Optional: Spritz with beef broth every hour after the first 3 hours\n" +

            "## Instructions\n\n" +
            "1. **Prepare the ribs**: Remove the membrane from the bone side of the ribs. Apply a thin layer of mustard all over the ribs, then generously apply the rib rub on all sides.\n\n" +
            "2. **Setup your EGG**: Set up your Big Green Egg for indirect cooking with the ConvEGGtor. Add a few chunks of apple or cherry wood for smoke. Stabilize temperature at 250Â°F (121Â°C).\n\n" +
            "3. **The 3-2-1 Method**:\n" +
            "   - **3 hours**: Place ribs on the grill, bone side down. Smoke for 3 hours, spritzing with apple juice every 45 minutes after the first hour.\n" +
            "   - **2 hours**: Remove ribs and place each rack on a large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of honey on top of each rack. Wrap tightly and return to the EGG for 2 hours.\n" +
            "   - **1 hour**: Unwrap ribs carefully (save the juices), brush with barbecue sauce, and return to the EGG for a final hour to set the sauce.\n\n" +
            "4. **Rest and serve**: Remove ribs from the EGG and let rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting between the bones to serve.\n\n" +
            "## Tips\n\n" +
            "- For baby back ribs, consider a 2-2-1 method instead as they cook faster than St. Louis cut ribs\n" +
            "- The ribs are done when you can twist a bone and it starts to pull away from the meat\n" +

            "## Ingredients\n\n" +
            "- 2 racks of St. Louis cut pork ribs or baby back ribs\n" +
            "- 1/4 cup yellow mustard (as a binder)\n" +
            "- 1/2 cup rib rub (recipe below)\n" +
            "- 1 cup apple juice for spritzing\n" +
            "- 1/4 cup honey\n" +
            "- 4 tablespoons butter\n" +
            "- 1 cup barbecue sauce of your choice\n\n" +
            "**Rib Rub:**\n" +
            "- 1/4 cup brown sugar\n" +
            "- 2 tablespoons paprika\n" +
            "- 1 tablespoon black pepper\n" +
            "- 1 tablespoon salt\n" +
            "- 1 tablespoon garlic powder\n" +
            "- 1 tablespoon onion powder\n" +
            "- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)\n\n" +
            "## Instructions\n\n" +
            "1. **Prepare the ribs**: Remove the membrane from the bone side of the ribs. Apply a thin layer of mustard all over the ribs, then generously apply the rib rub on all sides.\n\n" +
            "2. **Setup your EGG**: Set up your Big Green Egg for indirect cooking with the ConvEGGtor. Add a few chunks of apple or cherry wood for smoke. Stabilize temperature at 250Â°F (121Â°C).\n\n" +
            "3. **The 3-2-1 Method**:\n" +
            "   - **3 hours**: Place ribs on the grill, bone side down. Smoke for 3 hours, spritzing with apple juice every 45 minutes after the first hour.\n" +
            "   - **2 hours**: Remove ribs and place each rack on a large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of honey on top of each rack. Wrap tightly and return to the EGG for 2 hours.\n" +
            "   - **1 hour**: Unwrap ribs carefully (save the juices), brush with barbecue sauce, and return to the EGG for a final hour to set the sauce.\n\n" +
            "4. **Rest and serve**: Remove ribs from the EGG and let rest for 10-15 minutes before cutting between the bones to serve.\n\n" +
            "## Tips\n\n" +
            "- For baby back ribs, consider a 2-2-1 method instead as they cook faster than St. Louis cut ribs\n" +
            "- The ribs are done when you can twist a bone and it starts to pull away from the meat\n" +
            "- For a spicier rub, increase the cayenne pepper\n" +
            "- The saved juices from the foil can be mixed with your barbecue sauce for extra flavor\n\n" +
